**Description**

This project investigates various factors influencing real estate prices in two of the most affordable large cities in Greece: Lamia and Thessaloniki. These factors include proximity to cultural heritage sites, schools, infrastructure projects, and other elements that shape the property market. By analyzing data from online property listings, historical landmarks, educational institutions, and infrastructure developments, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the real estate landscape in these regions.


**Data**
The data includes:

1.**Property Listings:** Information such as location, asking price, square footage, year of construction, and number of rooms, collected from online real estate listings (March-August 2024).

2.**Cultural Heritage and Landmarks:** Locations and historical significance of sites such as Lamia Castle, the Archaeological Museum, and churches in the area.

3.**Schools and Infrastructure:** Details about schools, ongoing or completed infrastructure projects, and their influence on property values and the quality of life in the area.

**Mapping & Analysis**
The analysis uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to visualize the spatial distribution of property prices and key influencing factors, including cultural sites, schools, and infrastructure projects. An interactive map was created to show how these factors impact real estate values.
